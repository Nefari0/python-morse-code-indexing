# python-morse-code-indexing

# I wrote this code to varify the accuracy of my morse code practice sessions. It is one of the first python coding projects that I wrote, so the code needs work.

# The cwsent.txt file is where you load the text of the sent morse code messages.
# The cwrecv.txt file is where the recieved messages are loaded. 

# running all the code cells in the 'text index and test.IPYNB' file (in jupyter notebook) should process all the text. But there is an issue with the math in the accuracy calulation portion of the code that can return VERY false results. I will address this issue at some point. Other than that, all the characters are accurately tracked.

# the cw.txt file is just a log and really has no relevence.
